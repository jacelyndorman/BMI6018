#1.a
#Using the print() function only, get the wrong_add_function to print out where
#it is making a mistake, given the expected output for ex, "we are making an error 
#in the loop", which you would put near the loop. 
#Structure the print() statement to show what the expected output ought to be
#via f-strings: ie "The correct answer is supposed to be: [...]".
